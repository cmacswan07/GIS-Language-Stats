# GIS Language Stats

Running live at https://cmacswan07.github.io/GIS-Language-Stats/

A GIS app made using the ArcGIS JavaScript API. State, county, and congressional borders are all drawn by pulling GeoJSON data from ArcGIS. Language statistics are then pulled from the census API for each state, county, or congressional district when you select them via an AJAX call. You can control map layers using the layer widget at the top right, click a county or state layer to view the language statistics for those regions.
