# GIS Language Stats

Running live at https://cmacswan07.github.io/39dn_t2/

A GIS app made using ArcGIS' JavaScript API. Everything for the app is in index.html, so nothing needs to be executed or compiled to run the application.

You can control map layers using the layer widget at the top right, click a county or state layer to view the language statistics for those regions.
